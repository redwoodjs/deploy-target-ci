# v7 Notes

Here's a working list of changes we've had to make to these test projects for v7.0.0:

- node 20
  - remove `.nvmrc`
  - upgrade to node 20
  - upgrade engines field; can remove yarn 

- trusted documents/fragments
  - we may need the config in graphql.config.js; we'll see, leaving it out for now

- some dbauth breaking changes?

- remove prop types

- testing library jest breaking change; tsconfig needs updated?
